\item{max_thre}{the maximum threshold of the loop,}

\item{thre_step}{the threshold step of the loop,}

\item{mini_abun}{the minimum abundance of the loop,}

\item{mini_thre}{the minimum threshold of the loop,}

\item{height}{the height of the figure,}

\item{weight}{the width of the figure,}
}
\value{
