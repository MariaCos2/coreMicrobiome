\usage{
abun_occ_plot(otu, sample, mini_abun, threshold, sample_name, sample_group)
}
\arguments{
\item{otu}{a community count data matrix,}

\item{sample}{a sample information data.frame. The rownames must match the sample names in the otu,}

\item{mini_abun}{a value indicating whether the otu is present,}

\item{sample_group}{the name of a column that containing the sample type/group,}
}
\value{
A scatter plot showing the relationship between occupancy and abundance with color denoting and core or non-core otu.
